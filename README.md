# AI Scheduling ChatBot

For this project, we will be using two amazing tools: OpenAI for the NLP magic, and Gradio from Hugging Face to create a user-friendly UI. 

In this simulation, we'll put ourselves in the shoes of a real estate agent, working hard to arrange a house showing for a highly valued client. 

## Installation

1. Must have Python3.
2. Git repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msuliot/ai-scheduling-chatbot.git

3. use pip or pip3 to install any dependencies.

## Usage
